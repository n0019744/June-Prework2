        <h1><b><strong>Formatting Demo Page</b></strong></h1>
        <p>
        This simple page demonstrates the formatting tags covered in this lesson.
        </p>
        <h2><b><strong>Bold and Strong</b></strong></h2>
        <p>
        <b><strong>
        The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the strong tag also marks the enclosed text as more important. It is also easier for screen readers to read for the visually disabled.
        </b></strong>
        </p>
        <strong>This is what strong text looks like.</strong>
        <h2><i><em>Italic and Emphasis</i></em> </h2>
        <i>This text is in italics</i>
        <p>
        The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as the italic tag but the emphasis tag also marks the enclosed text as more important. It is also easier for screen readers to read.
        </p>
        <em>Emphasis: This is what emphasized text looks like.</em>
        <h2><b><strong>Subscript and Superscript</b></strong></h2>
